BASH Scripting on Linux
=======================

1. Bash (Shell) Scripts

File names "conventionally" end with .sh
File needs to have execute permissions (usually permission = 777)
Files are executed by the command

    $ cd /directory/where/script/is
    $ ./script.sh

or directly from any folder

    $ /absolute/path/to/the/script.sh
